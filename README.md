This is a Arg-Eager Algorithm implementation, which handles projective dependency trees only, mainly focused on the classifier, which is a Recurrent Neural Network.

prerequisite for this to run are
1.Python
2.Numpy 1.12 
3.Tensorflow 1.0 
4.gensim 0.13.4.1

usage:: 'python main.py -h' gives the usage.
