This is a Arg-Eager Algorithm implementation, which handles projective dependency trees only, mainly focused on the classifier, which is a Recurrent Neural Network.<br>


prerequisite for this to run are <br> 
1.Python <br>
2.Numpy 1.12 <br>
3.Tensorflow 1.0 <br>
4.gensim 0.13.4.1 <br>


usage:: 'python main.py -h' gives the usage.<br>

Data for training or parsing is not included in this repository.<br>
